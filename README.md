# TDD / BDD Final Project

Final Project for the Coursera course **Introduction to TDD/BDD**. By Akhilan Ganesh.

## Tasks

In this project I will use Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) techniques to write TDD test cases, BDD scenarios, and code, updating the following files:

```bash
tests/test_models.py
tests/test_routes.py
service/routes.py
features/products.feature
features/steps/load_steps.py
```

I am given partial implementations in each of these files.
